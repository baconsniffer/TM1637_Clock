- assume rtc is set to UTC
- on power-up (in setup())
-    see if signature bytes in nvram
-    yes, get standard time offset (-5 for EST) from nvram
-         get DST offset (-4 for EST) from nvram
-    no, go into timeset mode (get time, local standard timeand DST offset
-    see if rtc is running
-    yes, good to go
-    no,  go into timeset mode (get time, local standard timeand DST offset
-    good to go
-        - initialize the display
-        - setup time to sync with rtc (adjust for TZ and DST)
-        - setup periodic interrupt from rtc (once per second is probably enough)


- main loop
-    adjust display brightness
-    show the time
-    sleep() (until next interrupt)

- interrupt (once per second)
-    get the time in UTC
-    convert to local time based on TZ (using DST flag)
-    is it time to spring ahead?
-    yes, spring ahead
-    is it time to fall back?
-    yes, fall back

- spring ahead
-    offset used is DST offset

- fall back
-    offset used is LST (Local Standard Time)
